#Development Guide

Bdocker provides two daemons one for the working node and another one for the accounting node. They are implemented as
in RESTFUL APIs.

##Accounting REST API


The accounting API deploys a daemon in the accounting node, which will
listen the working node daemos and store the accouting information provided
from them.

More documentation will be provided soon.

##Working Node REST API

The working_node API deploys a daemon in the working nodes, which will
control the jobs configures under the bdocker environment.

More documentation will be provided soon.
